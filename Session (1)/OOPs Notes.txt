Class is having constructor: When we create object constructor will initialize object properties.

Class can also have multiple functions, when we create object each object can have access to that function.


Class we can re use  in the concept of inheritance

	class X extends Y 
		(Y is Parent and X is child)

	Child can access all parents functionality + properties

if child class is also having a constructor and you want pass a values from child to parent constructor we required super keyword.

If Child class is also having same method as parent have then child will use its own method and it will override its parents method this concept is called method overriding.
	
	if child wants to parent method as well then you can call it using super keyword.

	similar will word with variable as well.
