AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript XML

if you want to create Asynchronous Web Application then we can use AJAX.
AJAX enables to exchange data between client (browser) and server.

AJAX fetch data from server and display it on client side without interfearing the 
original behavior of your page. It will not load the full page, it will just load only the changes made.

Asynchronos: it is not synchrnous, one task is not waiting for the another,
             it doen'ts block any process.

Javascript: AJAX totally dependent on JS, Javascript used to manupulate DOM and print the 
            data get by AJAX

XMLHTTPRequest: allows you to send the HTTP request to server and received data in return way. XML basically says sending request to server

API (application program Interface)/ Restful API (server calls and to do that calls we can use XMLHttpRequest)

Async functionality we can handle either using callback or another option that is promise.
